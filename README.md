# Tail-Aware Sperm Analysis for Transparent Tracking of Spermatozoa

This is the official implementation of our approach for the Medical Multimedia Task: Transparent Tracking of Spermatozoa in MediaEval2022. The MediaEval 2022 Workshop will be held 12-13 January 2023, collocated with MMM 2023 in Bergen, Norway and also online.

## Update 16/01/2023: We received a distinctive mention in the 13th Annual MediaEval Workshop (MediaEval 2022) from the orgranizers of the Medico Medical Multimedia task.

## Abstract
Semen analysis is crucial to determine men's fertility; however, microscope-based manual spermatozoa evaluation is time-consuming and costly. Therefore, it has become essential to develop computer-aided-semen-analysis systems. To facilitate automated spermatozoa analysis, we propose a simple yet efficient framework for tracking sperms and predicting their motility. Different from existing methods, our proposed framework centralizes a new paradigm, dubbed sperm having a tail. We develop a novel tail-aware sperm detection model to advance the detection ability of dense, tiny, and transparent sperm cells. Furthermore, to enhance sperm tracking, a scene change detection technique is utilized to suppress identity assignment errors of similar sperms, resulting in improved sperm motility measurement. Experimental results show that our framework works well with an insignificant trade-off in execution time, which is suitable for the real-time clinical setting requirement.
